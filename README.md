# setting_up_cpp_tools
Repository for learning how to set up C++ best practices tools.

Initially, I would like to get it pretty close to [Jason's setup](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cmake_conan_boilerplate_template). But it was overkill for my needs,
and it's not the area I would like to study right now.
So I've settled with:
* Clang-format
* Clang-tidy
* Cppcheck
* Catch2
* Sanitizers
